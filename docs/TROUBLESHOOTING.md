# Troubleshooting

← [Back to README](../README.md)

## `no configuration file provided: not found`

If `docker compose` reports:

```text
no configuration file provided: not found
```

…you are running the command from a directory that does not contain `docker-compose.yml`. The compose file lives in `infrastructure/`, so any `docker compose ...` invocation must either run from there or be given an explicit path.

```bash
# Run from the infrastructure directory (recommended)
cd /path/to/cliproxyapi-dashboard/infrastructure
docker compose up -d --wait

# Or run from anywhere with --project-directory
docker compose --project-directory /path/to/cliproxyapi-dashboard/infrastructure up -d --wait
```

If you installed via `install.sh`, prefer the systemd unit — it already sets the
working directory correctly:

```bash
sudo systemctl start cliproxyapi-stack
sudo systemctl status cliproxyapi-stack
```

The systemd unit also uses `--project-directory` so it is safe to copy the
`ExecStart` line out of `systemctl cat cliproxyapi-stack` and run it manually
from any directory.

## Services Not Starting

### Local build vs image behavior (important)

For local development, `docker-compose.local.yml` builds the dashboard from your local source (`build: ./dashboard`).

If you previously used a pulled image or changed local files, always rebuild explicitly:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml down -v
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up -d --build
```

This avoids running stale dashboard images and ensures recent migration/entrypoint fixes are included.

### Windows: `entrypoint.sh` "No such file or directory"

If you see:

```text
[FATAL tini (7)] exec ./entrypoint.sh failed: No such file or directory
```

This is typically caused by Windows CRLF line endings in shell scripts. The Docker build now normalizes `entrypoint.sh` automatically, but if you still hit this after pulling updates, run a clean rebuild:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml build --no-cache dashboard
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up -d
```

**Check systemd status:**
```bash
sudo systemctl status cliproxyapi-stack
```

**Check Docker container status:**
```bash
cd infrastructure
docker compose ps
```

**View logs:**
```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

## Database Connection Errors

### Password Authentication Failed (error code 28P01)

If you see an error like:
```
error: password authentication failed for user "cliproxyapi"
  severity: 'FATAL',
  code: '28P01',
```

This is almost always caused by a **password mismatch** between your `.env` file and what PostgreSQL was initialized with.

> **Important**: PostgreSQL only reads `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` during **first-time initialization** (when the data volume is empty). If you change the password in `.env` after the database has already been created, PostgreSQL will still use the old password — but the dashboard will try to connect with the new one.

**Fix — Option 1: Reset the volume** (easiest, destroys all data):
```bash
# Local setup
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml down -v
./setup-local.sh          # macOS/Linux
.\setup-local.ps1         # Windows

# Server setup
cd infrastructure
docker compose down -v
sudo systemctl start cliproxyapi-stack
```

**Fix — Option 2: Update PostgreSQL password** (preserves data):
```bash
# 1. Find the current password in your .env
grep POSTGRES_PASSWORD .env

# 2. Connect to PostgreSQL with the OLD password and change it
docker compose exec postgres psql -U cliproxyapi -d cliproxyapi -c \
  "ALTER USER cliproxyapi PASSWORD 'YOUR_NEW_PASSWORD_FROM_ENV';"
```
If you don't know the old password, use option 1.

**Fix — Option 3: Revert `.env` to the original password**:
If you accidentally changed `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` in `.env`, revert it to the value that was originally generated, then restart the stack.

### General Database Connectivity

**Verify PostgreSQL is healthy:**
```bash
docker compose ps postgres
docker compose exec postgres pg_isready -U cliproxyapi
```

**Check credentials in `.env`:**
```bash
grep -E 'POSTGRES_PASSWORD|DATABASE_URL' infrastructure/.env
```

**Verify the password in `DATABASE_URL` matches `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`:**
The `DATABASE_URL` contains the password inline: `postgresql://cliproxyapi:<password>@postgres:5432/cliproxyapi`. If you set these manually, ensure both values use the same password.
## OAuth Callbacks Failing

**Verify firewall rules:**
```bash
sudo ufw status numbered
```

**Test OAuth port accessibility from external network:**
```bash
nc -zv YOUR_SERVER_IP 8085
nc -zv YOUR_SERVER_IP 1455
# ... test other OAuth ports
```

**Check CLIProxyAPI logs:**
```bash
docker compose logs -f cliproxyapi
```

## TLS Certificate Issues

**Check Caddy logs:**
```bash
docker compose logs caddy
```

**Verify DNS records:**
```bash
dig dashboard.example.com
dig api.example.com
```

**Common causes:**
- DNS records not propagated yet (wait 5-15 minutes)
- Firewall blocking ports 80/443
- Domain not pointing to correct IP
- Rate limit hit (Let's Encrypt has rate limits)

## Port Already in Use

**Find process using port:**
```bash
sudo lsof -i :80
sudo lsof -i :443
```

**Stop conflicting services:**
```bash
sudo systemctl stop nginx    # If using nginx
sudo systemctl stop apache2  # If using apache
```

## Dashboard Not Loading

**Check all services are healthy:**
```bash
docker compose ps
```

**Verify dashboard logs:**
```bash
docker compose logs dashboard
```

**Common issues:**
- Database not initialized (run `npx prisma migrate deploy` in container)
- JWT_SECRET not set in `.env`
- Dashboard container can't reach PostgreSQL

### Header shows "System offline" even though the proxy is healthy

If the management API is reachable (e.g. `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $MANAGEMENT_API_KEY" $CLIPROXYAPI_MANAGEMENT_URL/config` returns `200`) but the dashboard header still flags **System offline**, you are most likely hitting a name-resolution mismatch.

Earlier releases inferred liveness from `docker ps` filtered by an exact regex match against `CLIPROXYAPI_CONTAINER_NAME`. Docker Swarm names tasks `<stack>_<service>.<slot>.<task-id>`, so the static name never matched and the indicator was permanently red ([#215](https://github.com/itsmylife44/cliproxyapi-dashboard/issues/215)). Kubernetes, Nomad, and Compose without a pinned `container_name:` were affected the same way.

The current release decides liveness by probing the Management API directly, so the indicator now goes green under any orchestrator. The `CLIPROXYAPI_CONTAINER_NAME` variable is only consulted to populate the cosmetic uptime label via `docker inspect`; if the name does not resolve (Swarm task IDs, K8s pod IDs, no Docker socket) the uptime simply renders as unknown — the green dot still works. If you upgrade and the indicator stays red, check:

- The dashboard container can reach `CLIPROXYAPI_MANAGEMENT_URL` on the cluster network.
- `MANAGEMENT_API_KEY` matches the value the proxy is configured with — a mismatch now correctly surfaces as offline.

## Can't Login to Dashboard

There are no default credentials. The setup flow is:

1. **First Visit**: Navigate to `https://dashboard.yourdomain.com`
2. **Auto-Redirect**: You'll be redirected to `/setup` automatically
3. **Create Account**: Enter username and password to create the first admin user
4. **Setup Locked**: After first user is created, `/setup` becomes inaccessible

**If you forgot your password**, reset via the database:
```bash
cd infrastructure
docker compose exec postgres psql -U cliproxyapi -d cliproxyapi -c "DELETE FROM users;"
```
Then visit `/setup` again to create a new admin account.

**If setup page is not accessible**, it means an admin account already exists. Use your credentials to log in at the main login page.

## Usage Data Not Appearing

If your Usage page shows "No usage data" or outdated information, the usage collection service may not be running properly.

### Quick Diagnostics

```bash
# Check usage collector service status
cd infrastructure
docker compose ps usage-collector

# Check recent logs
docker compose logs --tail=20 usage-collector

# Verify API key is set
grep COLLECTOR_API_KEY .env
```

### Common Causes

1. **Missing COLLECTOR_API_KEY**
   ```bash
   # Generate and add to .env
   COLLECTOR_API_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
   echo "COLLECTOR_API_KEY=${COLLECTOR_API_KEY}" >> infrastructure/.env
   docker compose up -d
   ```

2. **Collector service not running**
   ```bash
   # Restart the usage collector
   docker compose up -d usage-collector
   ```

3. **CLIProxyAPI unreachable**
   ```bash
   # Check CLIProxyAPI health
   docker compose ps cliproxyapi
   docker compose logs cliproxyapi
   ```

4. **Database connection issues**
   ```bash
   # Test database connection
   docker compose exec postgres psql -U cliproxyapi -d cliproxyapi -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM usage_records;"
   ```

## Scheduled Backups Not Running

If the Settings → Backup page shows the schedule as enabled but `lastRun` never updates, the backup scheduler container is likely missing or unauthenticated. This is the usual case when upgrading an install that predates the scheduler.

### Quick Diagnostics

```bash
cd infrastructure
docker compose ps backup-scheduler
docker compose logs --tail=20 backup-scheduler
grep BACKUP_SCHEDULER_KEY .env
```

### Common Causes

1. **Missing `BACKUP_SCHEDULER_KEY` after upgrade**
   ```bash
   grep -q '^BACKUP_SCHEDULER_KEY=' infrastructure/.env || \
     echo "BACKUP_SCHEDULER_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)" >> infrastructure/.env
   docker compose up -d backup-scheduler
   ```

2. **Scheduler container never started**
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d backup-scheduler
   ```

3. **No admin user** — scheduled backups are attributed to the oldest admin. Create one via the dashboard before enabling the schedule.

4. **Verify tick in dashboard logs**
   ```bash
   docker compose logs dashboard | grep BACKUP_SCHEDULED_TICK
   ```

### Manual Collection Test

```bash
# Get API key from environment
COLLECTOR_API_KEY=$(grep COLLECTOR_API_KEY infrastructure/.env | cut -d= -f2)

# Test collection endpoint
curl -X POST https://dashboard.yourdomain.com/api/usage/collect \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $COLLECTOR_API_KEY" \
  -v
```

**Expected response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Usage collection completed",
  "recordsStored": 42
}
```

### Admin Refresh Button

As an admin user, you can manually trigger collection from the Usage page:

1. Login to dashboard as admin
2. Navigate to Usage page  
3. Click "Refresh" button (only visible to admins)
